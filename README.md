# odin-recipes
This is the first project in The Odin Project Foundations Course. It's about a simple website with recipes, without stylish it, only using HTML language

This project will demostrate I've learned the basics of HTML language, such as the boilerplate of a HTML document, using elements to make headers, paragraphs, emphazise, 
link pages, put images, make ordered and unordered lists and fill them with items; and attributes to give aditional information to those elements.

It will also help me understand, practice and learned about the command line, Git and Github.

In summary, Project: recipes will demostrate I have learned all the lessons previous to this point.
