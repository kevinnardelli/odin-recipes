# odin-recipes
This is the first project in The Odin Project Foundations Course. It's about a simple website with recipes, without stylish it, only using HTML language

This project will demonstrate I've learned the basics of HTML language, such as the boilerplate of a HTML document, using elements to make headers, paragraphs, emphasize text,link pages, put images, make ordered and unordered lists and fill them with items; and attributes to give additional information to those elements.

It will also help me understand, practice and learned about the command line, Git and Github.

In summary, "Project: recipes" will demonstrate I have learned all the lessons previous to this point.

I've completed the first and second lessons of CSS basics. I've added some CSS style to home, watermelon sangria and ceviche pages; they look bad, but my goal was to experiment with my new knowledge. I'm excited about this path!
